\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This chapter will summarize the thesis contributions, answer the research questions, discuss limitations and threats to validity, and propose directions for future work. In particular, it will reflect on how effectively the proposed approach detects schema evolution and regenerates mapping transformations using retrieval-augmented large language models, and how the approach compares with established mapping adaptation methods \cite{velegrakis2003mapping,yu2005semantic}.

At the current stage of the thesis, the conclusions chapter is intentionally concise and will be expanded after completing system implementation and experimental evaluation.
